        <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
        <h2>Aspiring Software Developer | Keyboard Enthusiast | Swing Dancer</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Adi Suresh, and I want to share my story with you. I've had an exciting journey moving through studying chemical engineering, working in diverse fields as a process engineer and finally pursuing Software development.</p>
        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>As far as I can remember, I‚Äôve always been someone who dives in head-first into anything I do. It‚Äôs common for me to start learning about a topic or skill, and within a few days, find myself staying up till 2am researching or practicing and forgetting that time exists. This is ultimately where I found myself with programming.</p>
        <p>I was a young engineer in the manufacturing world, when I stumbled upon this simple programming language called python and was intrigued. An idea for automating data entry using my new-found skills popped into my head but it was nothing concrete. Suddenly, three days later I found myself staying up till 3am on a random Friday night perfecting the solution that would end up saving me over 10hrs each week.</p>
        <p>I was addicted to the ways that I could create and build solutions with code that were useful to myself and those around me. It became clear to me where I belonged. Since then, I've completed a 14-week bootcamp at Tech Elevator to further my education in Full-Stack development. I was able to use some of these skills in developing a Spotify playlist generator in my spare time to learn even more while making something I've always wanted for myself.</p>
        <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>Outside of tech, my list of disconnected obsessions that have come and gone throughout my life includes ballroom dancing, piano, philosophy, yoyo‚Äôs, alternative keyboard layouts (yes I relearned how to type just for fun), programmable and split keyboards (using QMK), rock climbing, Spikeball, Tennis, and music composition. </p>
        <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
        <p>I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or simply curious about the intersection of manufacturing and software development, I'd love to connect with you as the thing I love above all, is getting to hear new stories.</p>
