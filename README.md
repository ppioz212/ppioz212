        <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
        <h2>Aspiring Software Developer | Keyboard Enthusiast | Swing Dancer</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Dustin Miller, and I want to share my journey with you. My life has been a fusion of finance, technology, and the art of espresso.</p>
        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>For nearly seven years, I carved out a successful career in wealth management. Yet, despite the accomplishments and accolades, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. It was during this time that I rediscovered my lifelong passion for technology.</p>
        <p>In collaboration with a friend on various tech projects, I had an epiphany. I realized how deeply I was drawn to the world of software development. The thrill of solving complex problems, the joy of creating something new, and the constant learning resonated with me on a profound level.</p>
        <h3>The Transition</h3>
        <p>That's when I decided to make a significant pivot in my career. I'm currently on an exciting journey to become a software developer. My background in wealth management has equipped me with essential skills - analytical thinking, effective communication, and an unyielding attention to detail. These attributes, combined with my unwavering passion for technology and lifelong learning, make me a unique candidate in the field.</p>
        <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in coding or enhancing my technical skills, you can often find me pursuing another passion - coffee. I'm not just your average coffee drinker; I'm a bona fide coffee enthusiast. I indulge in the art of roasting coffee beans and dive deep into the intricate world of espresso. It's a sensory experience that complements the logical and creative aspects of my life in technology.</p>
        <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
        <p>I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a coffee lover, or simply curious about the intersection of finance and software development, I'd love to connect with you.</p>
